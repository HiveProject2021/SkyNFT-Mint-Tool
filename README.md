# SkyNFT-Mint-Tool
  # Purpose: Synthesize multiple NFTS images online.

    # 1 Prepare a lot of transparent PNG images
    # 2 All images must be the same size
    # 3 The first picture is usually the background and will be placed at the bottom
    # 4 Support custom NFT work name and automatic numbering
    # 5 After synthesizing multiple images, you can directly import these NFT works into SkyNFT
    # 6 There are relevant codes for generating META files in the system, but they are not used in SkyNFT, so this part of the code is commented
    # 7 https://tools.skynft.org/ Online service version of current tools
    # 8 You can also deploy locally. If there is a path or permission problem, you can adjust it yourself.
